2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Multiplier_Top/fsm/Data_Out[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) Multiplier_Top/bm/HQ/Data_Out_reg[0]/CLR, Multiplier_Top/bm/HQ/Data_Out_reg[1]/CLR, Multiplier_Top/bm/HQ/Data_Out_reg[2]/CLR, Multiplier_Top/bm/HQ/Data_Out_reg[3]/CLR, Multiplier_Top/bm/Q11/Data_Out_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
